# Generic Library Catalog

## Description
This project implements a flexible library management system using Java Generics. It allows users to manage library items with customizable ID types (e.g., Integers, Strings) while maintaining type safety. The application runs via a command-line interface (CLI) to perform operations like adding, removing, and viewing items.

## Features
* **Generic Class Implementation:** Uses the `<T>` type parameter to allow flexible ID types for library items.
* **Data Management:** Supports adding new items, removing existing items by ID, and listing all items in the catalog.
* **Interactive CLI:** Provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction.

## How to Run
1. Compile the Java files.
2. Run `LibraryApp.java`.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to manage the library catalog.
